Easy-Weight
===========

Windows phone app intended to be as simple and elegant as possible.
===========

I haven't checked for windows phone, but I know for android and ios there are multiple weight loss apps with a full suite of different features, graphs, etc. That isn't what I want for this. This is to be a simple, elegant app built for myself to make tracking weight as easy as possible and hopefully in the process motivate me a little better as the effects of my efforts will be more obvious.

For now, I plan to have a home screen with only two functions:
1) Provide the easiest method possible for adding a weight entry to for the day. In other words, a text box to input weight (pounds, at least for now) and a button to send the data away and update the users stats.
2) A few lines indicating the users weight loss since the day before, the past week, and the first entry ever made.

That is all, and once I get this working to my satisfaction (As in, working and aesthetically pleasing design wise,) the application will be considered finished. However, possible additional features are possible.

Features I may want to add later:
- Support for different users
- Calorie inputs for an entry. This does not include a list of all foods, servings, where you got the food, blah blah blah. I want to keep with a simple, easy ideology here. That probably means one textbox with the option to add how many calories you've had/plan to have that day.
- Maybe some simple charts to display progress that past 3 months
- Exercise inputs. Again, this should be simple. Activity, length, difficulty. There could be an option to display entries for individual dates so users can see what they've done the past week.
- More to be looked at later?
